# Amazon Vine Analysis

## Project Overview
E-Commerce has been on a gigantic rise over the past couple of decades and continues to grow. By the day, more and more people are making their purchases online through outlets such as Amazon, eBay, Etsy, and many others. Along with this growth is the amount of information available about various products which can help influence what product the customer ultimately purchases. One big piece of that information - customer reviews. In this project we are going to look at what happens to customer review data when people are left to own devices to leave a review or if they're required to leave one based on the circumstances of gaining said product. 

The latter method is driven by a service called Amazon Vine. These members of Amazon Vine are provided products by Amazon where they are required to post a review after some time with the product. To become a member of Amazon Vine, you have to be a reliable reviewer on the Amazon platform. With enough feedback supplied, a Vine member is viewed as one who is able to give appropriate feedback information based on their prior set of product reviews. 

Now, we're going to look at review data for Video Games and Video Game Accessories and see if being a Vine member introduces bias into how products are reviewed.

As you see in the above image, we were able to gather data about the Video Game reviews and group them based on whether the review was from a Vine member or not. 

#### Total reviews 
Vine Members: 4291

Non-Vine Members: 1781706

#### Number of 5 Star Reviews 
Vine Members: 1607

Non-Vine Memebers: 1025317

#### Percentage of 5 Star Reviews
Vine Members: 37.45% of reviews had 5 stars

Non-Vine Members: 57.55% of reviews had 5 stars
 
## Summary
At least for Video Games and Video Game Accessories positivity bias does not exist. In fact, it seems that vine members held more scruitiny over Video Game related items more so than Non-Vine Members. Part of this may come down to a couple of possibilities: 
1) Vine Members are more critical of the products they review. Through their review experiences, they can better objectively analyze a product and give a likely less biased review on the product. However, on the converse of that...
2) Vine Members who are given video game products may not be fans of video games themselves. More information on how Vine Members are given items based on review history may better determine if the Vine-based review was based on a Vine member who actually enjoys video games or if the Vine member was simply handed a product just for the sake of reviewing it regardless of their preferences on video game products.
